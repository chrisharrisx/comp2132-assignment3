    PART 1

    Inside the assignment3.zip folder you should find this file (assignment3.html) and a folder of images. The folder contains 9 images, 3 of which are fruits (apple, banana, orange), 3 of which are grains (buckwheat, rice, wheat), and 3 of which are vegetables (bok choy, carrots, cauliflower)

    1.  Begin by creating an array of nine object literals. Each object in the array must have two properties: src, and type
          e.g.  { src: '', type: '' }

        Fill the src properties of the objects with the paths to the images, one path per object
          e.g.  { src: 'images/apple.jpeg', type: '' }
        
        Next, fill the type properties of the objects as appropriate with the types given above, one type per object
          e.g.  { src: 'images/apple.jpeg', type: 'fruit' }
        
        Store this array in a variable named 'data' such that once finished your code should look something like the following:

        const data = [
          { src: 'images/apple.jpeg', type: 'fruit' },
          ...fill in the rest of the objects here
        ]


    2.  Create a function named renderImage that accepts a single argument called 'obj'. Inside the function 
        add the following functionality:
        
        a.  create a string representation of an HTML img element using the path parameter
              e.g. const element = `<img src="${obj.src}">`

              in addition to the above, add a data attribute to the element, named data-type and populate it with 
              the object's type value

        b.  concatenate the string from step a to the .innerHTML of the element with class "images"


    3.  Next, use a for-of loop to step through the 'data' array you created in step 1. 

        Inside the loop, call your renderImage function, passing the current value as an argument 
        (to populate the 'obj' parameter). Make sure to pass the entire object to the function!


    4.  Verify that once the loop has finished running, you can see all nine images in the browser and they have 
        been inserted correctly into the .images div (check the elements tab of the developer tools). Ensure that each element 
        has the correct set of attributes:
          e.g. <img src="apple.jpg" data-type="fruit">


    PART 2


    5.  Now that you have verified your image paths are correct and images are displaying, fetch all the 
        image elements on the page via any suitable method (.querySelectorAll, .getElementsByTagName) 
        and store the results in a variable


    6.  Use the .map or .forEach array method to step through the array of elements you stored in step 4. For each element in the array, 
        read the type from the .dataset.type property

        If the type is grain, add a 10px solid red border to the element, e.g. elem.style.border = '10px solid red' (where 'elem' is
        the actual name of the variable defined in your .map or .forEach function)


    7. Verify in the browser that each of the three images of grains now has a red border around them
